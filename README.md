# DeepLearningClassHW

*Assignments for Deep Learning and Nerual Networks, three assignments in total*

#### Assignment 1
Regression and Classification
- Train a nerual network to approximate a unknown function
- Train a nerual network that maps an input image(from FASHIONMNIST) to one of ten classes. 

#### Assignment 2
Autoencoder and Variational autoencoder
- To implement, test, and analyze the convolutional autoencoder
- Use cross-validation to evaluate the final accuracy
- Denosie image using gaussian noise and implement&anaylze variational autoencoder

#### Assignment 3
Reinforcement learning (Deep Q Learning)
- Implement and test nerual network to solve reinforcement learning problem
- Train a deep RL agent on MountainCar-v0 and solve the problem
